# Smart Precision Agriculture with AI  
*A Silicon Labs powered project for predictive farming insights*  

## Overview  
This project is a **Smart Precision Agriculture system** built on **Silicon Labs technology**, leveraging **AI and IoT** to empower farmers with data-driven decisions.  

The system collects **real-time soil temperature** and integrates **3-day weather forecasts**, then applies AI-based analysis to provide **smart farming recommendations**.  

By combining **local sensor readings** with **predictive models**, the platform helps farmers:  
- Optimize irrigation schedules  
- Prevent crop stress  
- Anticipate weather impacts  
- Improve overall yield and efficiency

## Features  
- Soil Temperature Monitoring – Live readings from soil temperature sensors  
- Weather Forecast Integration – Fetches weather predictions for the next 3 days  
- AI-driven Analysis – Identifies anomalies and trends for better farm management  
- Smart Insights Dashboard – Provides actionable insights instead of raw data  
- Edge-ready Implementation – Runs efficiently on Silicon Labs hardware
